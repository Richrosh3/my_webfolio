        After graduating from the{" "}

          University of Maryland, College Park{" "}
        </text>
        with a <text className="font-semibold">Bachelors </text>
        in <text className="font-semibold">Computer Engineering, </text>I was
        fortunate to receive an offer from Northrop Grumman to work as a Software
        Engineer. As of now, I have been working for Northrop Grumman for a
        little over 1.5 years and have learned an extensive amount of material.

        Well, during the pandemic, I worked as a{" "}
        <text className="font-semibold">front-end developer </text>
        for a startup company. In this position, I fell in{" "}
        <text className="font-semibold underline">love</text> with working with
        a dedicated team of engineers, UI/UX designers, and the CEO of the
        company. The goal of the company was to create a mobile and web
        application that would allow affordable and accessible education to students all over
        the US. It was an amazing feeling to be able to see the work I had put
        in being used by various users. I began focusing on software engineering
        at that point, and specifically became more{" "}
        <text className="font-semibold underline">
          interested in full-stack development
        </text>
        . At Northrop Grumman, I feel the same euphoric feeling after finishing
        a difficult task, or seeing my work in action during a demonstration
        to our customers.

          Anyways, enough of my professional side!

        Outside of work, I've been really enjoying learning the guitar, watching movies, and playing a variety of sports.
        One of my personal goals this year is to read 25 books by the end of the year and I am thrilled to say I completed the challenge!
        Since I no longer have homework to do or exams to study for, I have been enjoying reading so much more.
        Another one of my goals was to finish the Richmond Half Marathon, and I'm proud to say I completed it ðŸ¥³!!!
        I absolutely hate running for long periods of time, but I feel like I should at least finish one full marathon in
        my lifetime. The Richmond Half Marathon felt so rewarding to finish, so I'm sure I'll feel even more ecstatic if I
        complete a full marathon.

      <p className="mb-5">
        Some life-long goals I have are to obtain either a Masters or PhD; not because I'm a natural student,
        but because at some point I want to become a professor at a university. Sadly, the advanced degrees are the
        minimal requirement to become a professor at a university ðŸ˜­. Alas, when the time comes, I will once again prevail
        against the hardships of studying. I also want to own a cafe by the time I'm 50. I just have a feeling it will be a 
        fulfilling and rewarding endeavor, and a way I can give back to the community once I get my feet grounded.
