But then Tamlin did bring up a good point that the entirety of the Spring Court, residents and all, were affected; which was honestly his fault, to begin with when he allowed Hybern to come to reside in his land. From the meticulous planting of seeds in the minds of the guards, the seductive nature she showed towards Lucien, and just pulverizing Ianthe; it was a pure masterpiece. The Fall of the Spring Court arc was 10/10 in my eyes. <br/><br/>That arc set the pace for the rest of the book, and I was definitely not let down. The addition of new characters, settings, relationships, powers, etc., lets your imagination run wild and maintains your fascination for the story. I absolutely loved the incorporation of the deep lore surrounding the Bone Carver, the Weaver, and Bryaxis. Being able to make bargains with these ancient beings adds such a cool aspect to the magic surrounding this world. <br/><br/>In terms of characters and relationships, it's so good to see that we get a deeper level of understanding behind some of them. I still feel so bad for my boy Azriel, but the type of pain Mor has held onto must be just as bad. I still didn't like that she used Helion as a way to get her point across to Azriel, but I do like how this whole mess is a realistic possibility. I loved Helion's interactions with the night court fam after the meeting. It's just nice to see old friends reunite just like Mor and Viviane. I was glad to see the forgiveness of Tarquin to the Night Court after the battle and loved the relationship that sporadically developed between Amren and Varian. Kalias and Thesan were cool, but I do wish to see deeper relationships with the others in the future. Jurian's betrayal completely blindsided me, but I really liked the way he portrayed himself as sort of a third party for the majority of the book. Also, I was genuinely surprised when I ended up liking Lucien again in this book. I wholeheartedly believed his downfall would be glorious after reading Mist and Fury, but against all odds, he seems to be a redeemed character and accepted as part of the Night Court. <br/><br/>I loved the role of the King of Hybern. He was kinda thrown in at the end of Mist and Fury as the climactic conflict, and his evil was definitely what it leveled up to be by the descriptions. However, in this book, we see him being so active as a menace to the Prythian. He's literally everywhere in Prythian and is the driving force of the story. I don't really know how the story progresses without him in the next two books, but I hope the antagonist follows the same portrayal of evil. One thing I just did not really understand is how Elain was able to cleanly pierce through him and that was the end of him. You would think the Cauldron would provide him regeneration abilities, shields, awareness, etc. if he's powerful enough to completely just snap the Weaver like it was nothing. It gave off the same ending as Amarantha; no real fight to the death, just one strike and it was over. I think the Suriel had a longer death than the King.<br/><br/>So many scenes in the book were done so well. The deaths of both the Suriel and the Bone Carver were done so well and it made you really feel for them. Their reoccurrence in the books was something I really liked. It kind of showed that Feyre was not only a hero to the Fae, but also to the others within Prythian and to the ancient ones. The Suriel scene kind of reminded me of the death of Rue in Hunger Games; tears forming in my eyes as I read through the passage. Other scenes, like the Ravens in the library, that battle in the Summer Court, and the retrieval of Elain in Hybern territory had my eyes glued to the page and my heart racing.<br/><br/>Did anyone else think the addition of Feyre's father was random af??? He has not been seen since the beginning of book 1, then randomly appears at the end of book 3 and gets less than a paragraph of dialogue before he is ultimately killed off all together. I think this was my least favorite part of the book. It kind of just seems that he had to be thrown in here because he has no use as a character otherwise, and if he was not killed off then fans would just have that doting question as to when he would be seen again and what was he doing. <br/><br/>Overall, I think this is my favorite book of the series so far. Just pure enjoyment all the way through the reading of this book. Mist and Fury was amazing as well, which I would describe as a 0 to 100 experience, but Wings and Ruin was 100 to 100. I'm kind of getting sad that I'm catching up to the series, but also so excited to see what happens next :)<br/><br/>Overall Score: 4.9/5",,,1,0

It gave the same sort of philosophical vibe but was not nearly as entertaining. The story was more of a collection of life lessons described as philosophical analogies; many of them relating back to <i>The Achelmist</i>. <br/><br/>I would rather have this lying on my coffee table cuz it's one of those books that you can turn to a random page and learn something from it; kinda like how you could open a photo album. It's nice to start from the beginning but it doesn't really hurt you if you don't. <br/><br/>Slightly disappointed a bit since I was expecting another beautiful story about the journey of a warrior reminiscent of <i>The Achelmist</i> - which is honestly my fault. <br/><br/>The text on the pages is colored a nice calming tone of blue, so I'll give it some brownie points for that. <br/><br/>Overall Score: 1.6/5",,,1,0

The crow helps the family independently in dealing with their versions of grief. <br/><br/>That's about all I understand from the novel. <br/><br/>It has a cohesive story, but I would honestly consider each excerpt more as a poem. Sometimes there are random pages where it's a culmination of onomatopoeia's said by the crow, sometimes the boys may just say one sentence, and sometimes the father becomes incoherent in his excerpt. I get that the book is about grief, utilizing the crow as a coping mechanism, and how it may affect families or how every individual accepts grief differently; but the way grief was portrayed in the book was just too whimsical for me. Like I never particularly felt the emotion of grief in the majority of the excerpts. Nevertheless, I enjoyed the use of the crow and the growth of the father and children as they overcame the loss of the mother. The end was kind of heartwarming, but at the same time, it didn't hit me that hard. <br/><br/>Overall, an okay read but it just wasn't my cup of tea. <br/><br/>Overall Score: 1.1/5",,,1,0

Akash and Bijal fly back to their home in Illinois to see their mother and celebrate the one-year remembrance of their father. During their time there, Renu reveals that she sold the house and is moving back to London, where she used to study. As the family remembers their father, they also confront past secrets that they have kept from each other. Renu has a past love that she left in London after being betrothed to Ashok, while Akash has still not come out to his family and is forced to face the mistakes he made to his first love. <br/><br/>Literally, a quarter way through the book, I was tired of Akash and Renu already because they just seemed absolutely miserable in life. Akash was continuously making terrible decisions and Renu kept putting such high expectations on herself; but overtime, you really see these characters develop to tackle their problems and come to terms with not being perfect. It was so weird to see because they never openly did the ""I love myself"" type of cliche that is normally seen in American self-reflection, but the result was the same. In this story, it felt true, at least in my experiences, to how many Indians deal with mental-illness, addictions, self-expression, expectations, racism, misogyny, homophobia, classism, and the list goes on. It's like the majority of the experiences my family, relatives, friends, and I were encapsulated nearly perfectly, which is why it felt so relatable. In the end, it's not like everything was perfectly solved, but you do feel content from seeing the progression of this family.<br/><br/>I do wish that Mr. Patel also included the viewpoint of Bijal because as an older brother I did personally relate to how he felt trying to meet the many expectations that were put on him. Also, his current problems with his marriage would have been an excellent addition to how he was feeling while mourning the remembrance of his father and the feelings of losing childhood memories once the house was fully vacant. Akash and Bijal had many fights while they were home, however we only got see Akash's point of view for each dispute. <br/><br/>It gave the same vibes as reading <i>Dava Shastri's Last Day</i>, which I absolutely loved, but on a much deeper level due to the internal dialogue of Renu and Akash. Waiting for more than half a year to find this book was worth it :) Hoping to read more of Neel Patel's work later!<br/><br/>Overall Score 4.8/5<br/><br/><br/><br/>",,,1,0

She ends up building friendships with a majority of the employees at the store; sending them gifts, sharing exciting news, and giving condolences to loss of family and friends. <br/><br/>I would say there’s no “meat” to the story. It’s a very surface level book that doesn’t bother to dive into the details of each characters life because they were genuine letters that were sent back and forth.

Some alternate realities will stick out to you where you’re actually interested and others are pretty boring so you just skim by the thought. <br/><br/>Since each description is based on a fictional dream, the stories are very thought provoking but once you finish the next chapter, you’ll probably forget the content of the previous one. I guess that kind of enhances the idea of these short stories being dreams. <br/><br/>Very easy read since you don’t really have to remember any keen details or the background of characters. I’d say this book is the equivalent of just putting on the tv or listening to random songs as background noise. I’d recommend it if you wanna turn your brain off and think about fascinating universes where time varies differently from our perspective. <br/><br/>Overall Score: 1.3/5",,,1,0

I think I quite literally despise Tamlin as much as Feyre does, but at the same time I think his character should still be appreciated for his role in book 1 and his actions amplify Rhys' character so much more in this book. STILL, I had no conception of him becoming a despicable snitch by the end of the book. <br/><br/>Literally, everything about Rhys is cooler; his powers, secrets, childhood lore, and his friends. I absolutely adore Mor, Amren, Azriel, and Cassian. I love that they are a bonded family that still has respect for Rhys as a High Lord; despite each nearly being as powerful as him. I knew Rhys and Feyre were gonna get together from book 1 and I even had someone accidentally spoil that they become a couple, and yet I have to admit how natural the relationship between Feyre and Rhys was compared to Tamlin; which should be the exact feeling since they are literally mates. He's still very meticulous in how he approaches things, but it was never a forced action that Feyre had to take. <br/><br/>Feyre was an absolute menace by the end of the book. Seeing her go from a broken state at the end of book 1, to slowly healing over time and being able to fight for her loved ones once again was inspiring. The fact that she was able to master a majority of her powers in such a brief time period and use them to fend off Hybern soldiers from Rhys and Velaris was so sick. The way the action unfolds as she utilizes all of her powers at once to fight off the soldiers and completely obliterate the Attor felt like I was visualizing a scene from a Marvel movie. Going from such a powerful state to once again begging on her knees at the mercy of the King of Hybern is very nostalgic from the first book. You would think that she would be broken once again as she is stripped from her mate and watched as her friends and sisters are tortured. But no. She becomes as meticulous as Rhys and decides to get revenge on the people whom she once called home, but are now enemies after they sold out her friends, family, and all of Prythian. <br/><br/>Once again the vivid world-building that Mrs. Maas does is incredible. As I read the descriptions of the settings, I was able to form clear pictures of the beautiful cities of Velaris and Adriata, the house of the Weaver, the caves of the Bone Crusher, the forests of Prythian, etc. She is truly an expert in this craft. <br/><br/>For A Court of Thorns and Roses, I said the story was a bit slow at times, but I think this book was perfectly paced. Just the right amount of time between each action point in the plot to dive deep into lore, relationships, world-building, etc. I also mentioned that I did not like how Feyre became an immortal High Fae after dying, and would rather have had Tamlin give up his immortality. But now I totally understand why Mrs. Maas made this decision and it becomes the driving plot of Feyre's future actions.  I think almost every qualm I had in the last book was addressed in this one. Even the Attor and the King of Hybern felt more evil compared to Amarantha in this book. <br/><br/>Okay, but my actual only problem in this book is how Lucien and Elaine are thrown together as mates right at the end of the book. You have people waiting in line like Azriel and Mor, which I am literally begging to actually happen in the future book, but somehow Lucien of all people finds his mate in the middle of a dramatic scene where Feyre's sisters are unwillingly transformed into High Fae??? Just seems a little out of place, but I predict that it definitely has someway in shaping Lucien's behavior around Tamlin and Feyre in the next book. I am going to rage if Lucien & Elaine or Nesta & Cassian happen before Azriel and Mor. <br/><br/>ALSO BRO WHY ARE THEY SO FERAL LMAO. Like HUHHHH what was all over the bed Feyre?? ",,,1,0

It felt kind of scary how all the descriptions were so natural and not overdone, making it way too realistic. <br/><br/>We follow Gilda, our main character, as she loses the fight against mundane tasks and anxiety. One day, she receives an ad for free therapy sessions. She decides to take the offer and goes to the location, only to find out that she has been divinely tricked by the Catholic church. The priest walks out and mistakes her as a person seeking employment for the empty secretary role. Not wanting to disappoint the priest, she goes along with the misunderstanding .... for multiple months. She's able to hide the lie pretty well, as well as the fact that she's an atheist and a lesbian. She must keep this a secret to maintain her job and survive with what minimal money she has. Hiding it is not much of an issue though since most of her coworkers are really old and are highly impressed by her technical skills<br/><br/>The story wasn't really interesting to me until the murder mystery was introduced halfway through the book. Grace, the previous secretary, died unexpectedly but it was thought to be due to her old age. The police come to the church and reveal that her death was unnatural and is being deemed as murder. Gilda becomes fixated on this and starts to passively investigate some of the church staff who she believes to be possible suspects. As this goes on, we also get peeks into her daily life, where she struggles to keep her home clean, stabilize her relationship with her family, and respond to the girl she's been seeing. We slowly see all of this fall apart as the story progresses. <br/><br/>I think for most of the story, I was uninterested in Gilda and her ability to keep her lies hidden. Most of the situations she got in became such a mess and made me feel anxious for her. A lot of her actions throughout the book were quite literally unhinged. Sometimes the answers to her problems were so easy, but she just couldn't seem to act on correct decisions. I guess this made me really dislike Gilda for most of the story. You feel so much pity for Gilda, but at the same time, I would always think that this situation could have been avoided if she just really thought about her decisions. It's not her fault either. She's battling mental illness and the US health system has literally failed her time and time again throughout the novel. But I can't help think about that as I watch someone spiral out of control. <br/><br/>I didn't hate the book, but also for the majority of the novel, I wasn't super interested in what was happening. It was until the last chapter, that I couldn't stop flipping the pages to see what happened next. Also, despite the reviews stating that most people bawled their eyes out while reading this book, I did not shed a single tear UNTIL the last chapter where Rosemary consoled Gilda. One line made my eyes swell up so fast. <br/><br/>Ultimately, a pretty good read and masterfully written. I can't help but compare it to <i>Chemistry</i> by Weike Wang. The same type of vibe in terms of mental health, except the story was not unhinged and did not make me feel anxious. Highly recommend that book!<br/><br/>Overall Score: 3.4/5<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Sidenote: Guys, unfortunately, ima have to reduce my reading goal to 25 cuz ain't no way ima finish 50 books by the end of the year if I'm also reading the ACTR series.

IS THIS WHAT THE GIRLIES HAVE BEEN READIN????<br/><br/>I actually really enjoyed almost everything about this book. Reading about a magical world similar to the LOTR or the Percy Jackson series gave me so much childhood nostalgia and I was so invested in the description of the world and its characters. I'm giving it even more points for the fact that the Fae all look different and have various abilities.  That was one of my biggest gripes with the LOTR series. All the individuals within each race in LOTR don't have much of a difference between each of them. However, the Faeries have different abilities, look completely different from one another, and are characterized by distinct personalities. I think that is genuinely one of my favorite things about the book. <br/><br/>The introduction to Feyre was amazing. Badass girl fighting to keep her family alive, which gave me Katniss Everdeen vibes. She had such a dramatic character development throughout the book. Annoyance at her impoverished conditions, courage in protecting her family, fear when she was stolen from her home, depression as she is forced to adapt to a new lifestyle, love as she relishes in her surroundings, shame when she leaves her love to fight his battle alone, etc. I think by the end of the book, she is glad to be with Tamlin, but also feels utterly hopeless after committing such tragic acts to save the life of her lover and the rest of Prythian. I'm not gonna lie, I absolutely love that she falls into such a broken state. It's cool when characters are written into such heroic descriptions or have amazing endings by the end of the book. But to be able to vividly describe how a person becomes so mentally and physically exhausted is so difficult to do, and yet I find it so beautiful. Anyway, all this is to say that I see Feyre as an almost perfect character. <br/><br/>The rest of the characters are so well written as well and they all play a part in Feyre's journey. From the very beginning with her attack on Andras to her goodbye with Rhysand. I think my least favorite characters were probably Amarantha and the Attor, not because they're evil, but because they were so hyped up by Tamlin and Lucien to be overwhelmingly malevolent creatures. I don't think we really got to see how evil they really were. It's like if all wizards hyped up Voldemort, and then all we see in the movies is that he ruins the Ministry of Magic. We got a slight glimpse of Amarantha's ruthlessness as she pounded Feyre's body to the floor multiple times til she was bent like a pretzel, but like that was less than a chapter's worth ya know? I feel very torn on the fact that I like Rhysand. He's very methodical in his actions and thinks about the overall outcome, but the way he comes across as snarky and predatorial bothers me. At least he gave Feyre a sick tattoo. <br/><br/>Parts of the plot are so overbearingly predictable, that it makes me physically cringe sometimes as I read the book. Amarantha's whole riddle thing annoyed tf out of me. I read it and knew immediately that it was love, but it was dragged on for so long until Feyre was literally on the brink of death. Also, I'm getting a gut feeling that Feyre and Rhys end up together and I really do not like that at all. She is truly a victim of Stockholm Syndrome; both to Tamlin, and Rhys. But at least she had good times with Tamlin. I'm gonna be so sad if she does my boy dirty. <br/><br/>One last thing that I did not like is that they brought Feyre back as a High Fae. I'm guessing that it's all a foreshadowing moment since the girl named Feyre becomes a Faerie, but like that takes so much out of her character. Feyre was strong because despite being a human, she fended off multiple faeries, held her chin high against the literal evil queen of faeries in Prythian, and did not see her lack of magic as a major flaw in herself. Now that she has all these abilities and strengths, it kind of weakens her character for me. Obviously, you have to keep the main character alive, but I think it would've been even better if Tamlin exchanged his immortality to keep Feyre alive. Tamlin would still be powerful and live for a long time, just not eternity. <br/><br/>Overall, I'm very glad I read this book and can't wait to read the rest of the magical smut series! I do agree that the book can be slow at times, but if it builds the world to be so scenic and diverse, then I'm all for it.<br/><br/>Guys, I learned a new word!<br/><br/><u>flummoxed</u><br/><i>/ˈfləməkst/</i><br/><b>adjective</b><br/> bewildered or perplexed.<br/><br/>Overall Score: 4.4/5",,,1,0

Since Rintaro’s parents passed away when he was young, he’s been staying with grandfather for quite some time. He’s pretty reclusive, so he tends to skip school and just read at the shop. After his grandfathers funeral, his lovely aunt tells him that he could stay with her, which agreed upon. Realizing that since his grandfathers is now gone, the shop would have to close. He stays there a bit longer and keeps the shop open, following the same daily rituals his grandfather did. He doesn’t talk to many people, but a couple of particular classmates come by on random occasions; one of them being his class rep, Sayo. Sayo always bugs Rintaro to come back to school and he doesn’t seem why she cares so much since he’s moving soon anyways. One afternoon, an orange cat appears before him and tells him that some books need to be saved. With a minimal amount of convincing, the cat wins and Rintaro joins the cat for an adventure. <br/><br/>That’s pretty much how the story gets started and the duo go on 4 magical journeys to save books (Sayo ends up joining the adventures as well). As the story continues, you see Rintaro, who was once a sorrowful and reclusive boy, become confident and independent. He manages to gain courage and become a better person with the help of Sayo and of course the orange cat. <br/><br/>Each adventure wasn’t the most thrilling, but I thought it was really wholesome and honestly made me appreciate books more. I thoroughly enjoyed all the characters in this book; they were just all so likable and were necessary for the progression of the story. The only qualm I had with the book is that the cat isn’t as active in the saving of books as the title suggests. The title should be more like “The Cat Who Guides a Teenage Boy to a Magical Realm to Save Books”; but still, he’s a cool cat. <br/><br/>I feel like this would be a great bed time story for kids. <br/><br/>Overall Score: 3.6/5.0",,,1,0

Mira lives her life at college and meets a woman named Annie - who she eventually falls for.

As time goes on, Mira's father's health deteriorates and he eventually passes away with Mira at his bedside.

She becomes a leaf with her father. Idk how, but somehow she becomes a leaf and she seems to enjoy it. So much so that she does not want to ever go back to being a human. Mira and her father have conversations as they are in leaf form. Mira seeing that this is an option for the afterlife is convinced it's not so bad. Her father attempts to prove to her that it is not her time and that there is so much more she is to experience in her human life. Mira is semi-convinced, but even if she wanted to go back to human form, she doesn't know how. That's when Annie joins the story again and pulls Mira out of the leaf. Annie helps get Mira back on her feet and eventually leaves again. Mira, still in love with Annie, is still struggling to understand their relationship and how she fits in a world without her father. She goes to Annie to confess her love but fails to get the words out. <br/><br/>Okay, that's as much as I'll explain because I wasn't really satisfied with the ending of the story, but I guess it's kind of happy for Mira. <br/><br/>***End of spoilers***<br/><br/>The writing of the story itself was genuinely so creative; although, sometimes the way Miss Heti articulated some metaphors had me like ",,,1,0

Didn't do anything too wild, focused on what mattered most to him, and was oblivious to the other's perception of him because he just didn't really care. Hatsue, the daughter of the wealthiest islander, was overall a jovial character that exuded that pureness of youth. I don't read too many romantic stories, but even I thought they were such a cute couple and they had moments that made me smile like a middle school boy who just hugged his crush. Shinji had all the odds stacked against him, since he comes from a broken family, was not wealthy, and the island was very conservative when it came to dating. However, Shinji was still a respectable young boy among his peers and on the island. He knew the only way to win over Hatsue's father was to earn his respect. <br/><br/>I really liked Hatsue cuz she was never a ""damsel in distress"" type of character. In most situations, she made the first move; even when she was forbidden to see Shinji by her father, she still attempted to see him as much as possible. She was very independent and was fighting her own battle for love while apart from Shinji. While Shinji attempts to gain the respect of Hatsue's father, Hatsue is doing everything she can to earn the respect of Shinji's mother. <br/><br/>At the climax, Shinji completes a difficult task that earns the respect of many fishermen, the islanders, and Hatsue's father. Hatsue also gains the respect of Shinji's mother by winning a competition and offering a gift to his mother. In the end, their wishes are fulfilled, and live happily ever after. <br/><br/>I'm honestly quite shocked that this is the same author that wrote <i>Life For Sale</i>. That book had the wildest scenarios and you could never guess what was happening next. <i>The Sound of Waves</i> was really tame, and I don't think I'm really a fan of that cuz it took me forever to finish this book even though I enjoyed it.

So I picked up the novel that pushed him to stardom in Japan. <br/><br/>The critique of Murakami was definitely correct. 5 pages of Reiko's backstory was enough to make me feel uncomfortable for two days. <br/><br/>Other than that section of the novel, I thoroughly enjoyed the rest. Every character serves a purpose in Toru's life. Mostly because he doesn't go out of his way to make friends, but when he does, they serve an important role. All of these characters were likable in their own way and each have their own flaws of course. Even an asshole like Nagasawa can have shining traits to him at times. <br/><br/>What was interesting to me was that the pace of the plot never seemed to revolve around Toru, the main character. Naoko's well-being seemed to hold a precedent over his life and would direct nearly all his actions. I found this to be sweet, but at the same time so discouraging since we know it would never work out between them from the first chapter. <br/><br/>I really like Toru as a character. I saw a bunch of reviews detailing how pitiful he was, which I find so compassionless. He had gone through so much starting at 17 years old, and the pain never really left him. Haunted by loss and love, he truly did the best that he could do at all times. He never really moped around or felt entitled to anything. He worked hard for his money, his education, and himself; albeit, even if it was just to keep himself busy. Of course, he had his ups and downs, but what kind of human wouldn't? <br/><br/>There's a lot of suicide in this story. The death of some of these characters left me feeling so demoralized. The first sentence of chapter 11 tore my heart out of my chest and had me yelling into my pillow that life was so unfair. However, the ending was somewhat wholesome even if the book did leave me feeling numb til I fell asleep. I truly wish the best for everyone, but novels such as this remind me that some people just do not get that opportunity in life. <br/><br/>Loved the rollercoaster of emotions this story took me through. Will be reading another work by Murakami soon :) <br/><br/>Overall Score: 4.5/5",,,1,0

So when I randomly picked this book up in a cute bookshop in DC, I was so excited. Although, Dazai wrote <i>No Longer Human</i> years later, the characteristics of Yozo fit so well and it didn't feel abnormal to read about Yozo again. <br/><br/>The story itself is not particularly exciting; I mean the story revolves around Yozo being in the hospital for less than a week, so not much happens. But the vibe of the book was just really warming, even though Yozo just went through such a tragic event. Basically, Yozo's friends come to console him while he's in the hospital, and they have a great time together while also tiptoeing around the dark atmosphere of Yozo's depression and suicide attempt. It's just nice to read about someone having such great companions in their life. <br/><br/>Dazai just randomly interjects his thoughts, opinions, and rants throughout the novel. A character could be in the middle of dialogue and then he'll randomly input his hatred for the character that he is literally writing about. <br/><br/>My favorite line from the book is: <br/><br/><blockquote><br/>""White smoke from the volcano on Oshima, just above the horizon, drifted up into the sky. <br/>Nevermind. I hate describing scenery"" <br/></blockquote><br/><br/>That's literally the hardest line from all his novels. Bro was ahead of his time.

So he quits his job, puts an ad in the newspaper saying ""Life For Sale"", and just waits at his apartment.

The main character Jean-Baptiste Clamence kind of steals the whole narration, and describes the facial expressions or even skips over the whole dialogue with the narrator. So is it really third person, or is it second person and Jean is just narrating his story to a random person??? idk, but it is really hard for me to wrap my head around it for some reason. <br/><br/>Anyways, the story starts when Jean starts talking to the narrator in an Amsterdam bar. He's really respectful and social; which just comes off as odd. He hypes himself up and starts describing his life as a lawyer and how he was so good to those in need. As I described in my first sentence, he is all of those traits. So you can't really take his word for it, but you just go along with it at first. He admits at the end of the first encounter, that it is not out of the goodness of his heart that he treats everyone with respect; he does it to keep up an outstanding reputation. The story follows him over 5 days. After every encounter with him, you peel back a layer of his personality and realize that he is the scum of the earth (by social standards of course). It's quite literally a verbal ""Fall from grace"". Although you can't believe 100% of what he says, I do find it respectable that he is honest about his flaws. <br/><br/>I do think this was a pretty average read in terms of how engaged I felt throughout reading it, but the concept and the perspective of narration intrigue me. <br/><br/>Overall Score: 3.5/5",,,1,0

Unfortunately, I found it dull and very, VERY, slow. <br/><br/>The story is comprised of 4 different situations of certain people traveling back in time in the cafe.  The majority of these characters are reoccurring in all 4 scenarios. The basic idea of this version of time travel is that a person can travel back in time while sitting in the seat of a specific cafe. Once you are in the past, you cannot move from your seat and you must finish your coffee before it gets cold. The actions you make while in the past, do not affect the present at all. <br/><br/>MY BIGGEST PROBLEM WITH THIS BOOK IS THAT NOTHING HAPPENS. <br/><br/>Because no actions you make in the past affect the present, the story seems to have no driving plot. <br/>It kind of takes away the mysteries of time travel. The butterfly effect is completely taken off the table, the idea of multiple timelines is basically destroyed, and one can argue that there is no reason to visit the past since nothing actually changes. <br/><br/>The characters that time traveled really only get closure or at least something to think about from their visits to the past. But like 3 out of the 4 characters could have just gotten a therapist. Like why even travel into the past anyways???<br/><br/>I only really enjoyed the second story since it felt more unique and heartwarming. It's about a husband with dementia and a wife that has seen it coming for a long time but has to come to terms with it. I feel like you could read just the second story and feel fulfilled by the book. The other stories just seem so typical. <br/><br/>I think I'm just really mad it took me so long to read this book because I was so bored.

Oddly enough I feel like <i>Kafka on the Shore</i> was a darker, twisted, fantasy version of <i>Norwegian Wood</i>. Both novels are entwined in realism, but this book is a little more magical. <br/><br/>The story revolves around a 15-year-old boy who names himself Kafka. He leaves home because his dad isn't the best and curses him with an Oedipus-like prophecy. At the same time, the story also revolves around a 60-year-old man called Nakata who lost the ability to read, write and comprehend things after a bizarre accident when he was young during the war. Their stories alternate throughout the book and, at first, seem to have no relevance to each other. Eventually, their paths cross - but not really - causing both of them to be on the run from the police and fix their lives. <br/><br/>Sound normal? Well, it really isn't at all. <br/>The novel is written with magical realism; so, while most of the story seems like the ordinary everyday lives of these two individuals, there are also random elements of fantasy written sprinkled around the book. When we meet Nakata, he's able to talk to cats. He doesn't know why he's able to talk to cats, just that after the mysterious accident he gained that ability. Eventually, he gains other mystical abilities on a quest to flip over a stone that will close the portal to another realm. Kafka, while on the run from the police, gains the ability to see a ghost. That he falls in love with. That also happens to be the ghost of a living 50-year-old librarian name Miss Saeki whom he kind of works for. That also may or may not be his mother...<br/><br/>Honestly, the novel ends up feeling like a fever dream as you continually read it. There were points in the book where it just felt like the most random things were happening and you just gotta keep reading to see what happens. At one point I think Murakami himself shows up in the middle of the novel in the form of Colonel Sanders - literally the KFC mascot. He's like a pimp in the book, but also just a concept; whatever that means. <br/><br/>My favorite characters were Nakata, Oshima, and Hoshino. They were kinda just vibing throughout the novel and were just cool people in general. The interesting thing I experienced was getting bored of Kafka's perspective and then being able to read Nakata's update in the next chapter and vice-versa. It was really refreshing and made getting through the story easier. Somehow their lives intertwine and even now I'm still trying to piece together how and why. <br/><br/>There are a lot of mysterious riddles left unsolved after finishing the book so be prepared for that feeling of confusion. The mystical realm kind of feels like an unfinished concept, but that adds to the mystery which is what I guess Murakami wanted. <br/><br/>I definitely enjoyed <i>Norwegian Wood</i> way more, but this was still a fun read. <br/><br/>@ex-wifey. If you see this I kinda wanna know what you thought of the book cuz I still don't really understand what happened. <br/>P.S. the kids miss you. come home <3<br/><br/>Overall Score: 3.5/5",,,1,0

Obviously, we could label her life down to the theme of careerism; but, I feel as if that's simplifying it too much. Her obsession to control the narrative of her life is her way of making meaning out of her life and her legacy.<br/><br/>I love Dava's character. Being Indian myself, I see my mother in Dava. A total badass, but also filled with annoying flaws that make me love her even more.  It was so interesting for me to see similar cultural, social, emotional, mental, and financial aspects of life through just one character. Honestly, this is the first contemporary novel I've read featuring an Indian main character and a multicultural family with modern-day relationships. None of those themes overbore the sense of grief throughout the novel. The family, including Dava herself, had to come to terms with her planned death; all within a short period of time.<br/><br/>Dava's secrets drive the story. Each one reveals the relationship between her and her children; not to mention how spicy each secret is. Such a strong-willed person is brought to their knees on some occasions. The ability to recognize her tragic past, and put it away to build a successful future is so heart-rending but is also so inspirational. By the end of the book, it had me questioning what I would want people to recognize me for. <br/><br/>I am definitely biased since I feel like I can relate to the main character so well, but I would go as far as to say that this is one of the most enjoyable books I've read so far in my 23 years of life :)<br/><br/>I will absolutely be reading more of Kirthana Ramisetti's work in the future!<br/><br/>Overall Score: 4.7/5",,,1,0

It's structured as a semi-chronological logbook of a ship traveling through space. I say semi-chronological because it follows an interesting pattern where groups of 10s may be out of order, but the factors of 10s are in order. (You'll understand as you read through the book)<br/><br/>Here's the basic rundown. Employees on a ship traveling through space. Some are human, some are humanoids (robots with AI sentience and biological features of a human). Objects are placed in a special room of the ship and get switched out routinely. The objects have powers (maybe?). Humans and Humanoids report to a third party. Something goes wrong and a third party steps in. A weird ending happens that I don't know if I'm happy with. <br/><br/>Don't ask me what the objective of the ship and its employees were, the purpose of the objects, who the third party is, etc., because I have no idea. I wish I could tell you, but that synopsis I gave you above is the best I could do. <br/><br/>I found it funny that I related to the humanoids more and enjoyed their logs more than the humans. Their stories are just more interesting. They are told that they are updated versions of humans, but they also know that they are sentient robots. The majority of the humanoids all kind of felt the presence of emotions, or at least the thought of having emotions. The humans, all kind of seemed boring to me. They all left Earth for their own reasons, and most of the human logs described how much they missed Earth. The relationships between humans and humanoids never seemed to be overtly hostile; which I enjoyed. In fact, some of the humans and humanoids were friends that would regularly eat together in the canteen. I was relieved it did not turn into a humans-versus-humanoids war story. <br/><br/>I want to throw out a wild guess based on the title ""The Employees"" and say the story depicts our current societal views on big corporations and workplaces. <br/><br/>Maybe the ships true objective is meant to be unknown because no employee really knows what the truth behind corporations goals are or what they're doing behind closed doors. <br/>Maybe the distinction between humans and humanoids is a reference to the new and older generation of workers? or perhaps a separation of lower and higher classes?<br/>Maybe the unknown third-party makes us question who is the real head of a company? <br/>And Maybe the weird ending is supposed to signify that nothing matters anyways because big corporations don't care about your lives?<br/><br/>Lots of maybe's and so many more questions as I read this book. Definitely a book that makes you put together pieces of a puzzle and think as you read it. <br/><br/>I will definitely be reading this book again in the future to make more sense of it. I can already tell it will be just as good a second time. <br/><br/>Overall Score: 3.9/5",,,1,0

I could not help but feel sympathetic towards Kazuko as she went through pitiful interactions with her mother, brother, and MC. <br/><br/>Her relationship with her mother was truly inspirational, but at the same time felt so pathetic. Such selfless love for someone, only to be treated as second-class compared to her brother. I felt sorry for Kazuko because she was trapped. Having to spend so much love on someone while not being able to explore love for yourself must have been so taxing. This relationship makes you realize that love can be a double-edged sword. <br/><br/>I thought her interactions with MC were the absolute worst; mainly because I believe MC to be the human embodiment of the scum under a frat boy's fingernails. I respect Naoji for at least acknowledging that he is disgraceful and unworthy of the love of his mother and sister. MC, on the other hand, is totally delusional about the fact that he is a walking black hole that sucks the life force of humans and transforms them into lifeless stars. It felt so disheartening to see Kazuko, a character that I highly respected, become infatuated with such a terrible person. At the same time, I understood her longing for being wanted and could not blame her for falling into his trashy appeal. <br/><br/>In the end, we see such a great redemption arc from Kazuko. As the sun sets, a new day is to come. So is the same for the story of our new Kazuko. Her new life as a single mother will be difficult, but it excites me to know that the child won't be influenced by their piece of shit father :D<br/><br/>Overall Score: 4.6/5",,,1,0

In the same way, I find Oba Yozo to be absolutely deplorable. I find the resolution to the story to be a total cop-out and unfair to those going through depression. I understand that Yozo has become so detached and desensitized to his surroundings due to experiences he has been through in the past - making him ""no longer human"" - but I still can't help but hate his actions and his cowardly demeanor. <br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, this story pulled at the strings of my heart at times and had me screaming silently into my book simultaneously. Dazai is obviously a master of his craft, which makes it even heavier when I consider this story to be his last memoir before his suicide. <br/><br/>This was the first piece of Dazai's work that I have read, and it will definitely not be the last!<br/><br/>Overall Score: 4.3/5",,,1,0

She's a total badass and my imagination ran wild with the situations she was put through. <br/><br/>I obviously don't hate the story, but at the same time, I don't think it particularly has any spectacular feature that sets it apart from any other young-adult dystopian society book. <br/><br/>I will say though, that this story would have absolutely thrived in the Hunger Games, Divergent, Maze Runner era when I was in middle school.<br/><br/>Overall Score: 3.7/5",,,1,0
